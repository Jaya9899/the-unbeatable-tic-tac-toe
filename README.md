# the-unbeatable-tic-tac-toe

A small project of tic tac toe where the computer is actually smart.
Its tough to beat this one, because it uses MiniMax Algorithm which ensures that the computer will either:
1) Win 
2) Draw (with the most number of moves possible) aka (giving up with honour)

### Why did I do this project?
I started this project just to brush up on my python and tkinter skills. It did teach me about a whole new
algorithm in the process! It was interesting to apply a MiniMax algorithm in game theory and it really made my
test runs more fun (I wasn't winning anymore!) 

### Features
- Basic 3x3 GUI using Tkinter  
- Computer opponent with Minimax logic   
- Win/draw detection

This project was made using:
- Python
- Tkinter (GUI)
- MiniMax Algorithm

### Further Improvisations
- Integration of AI
- Cuter GUI (for the aesthetics)
